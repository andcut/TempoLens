# TempoLens product

TempoLens is a post-game analysis tool that treats time as a resource. It combines engine evaluation with clock equity to label moves and highlight time-management mistakes.

MVP goals:

- Compute think times and time equity.
- Run Stockfish to evaluate positions.
- Produce per-move labels and explanations.
- Provide a local desktop UI and a CLI for batch analysis.
